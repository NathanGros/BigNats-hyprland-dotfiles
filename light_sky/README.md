## !!! IMPORTANT !!!
Change (or not) the wallpaper and user profile picture in `.config/hypr`.

I **highly** recommend looking at the `.config/hypr/conf/bindings.conf` file to learn all the bindings.

**I use zsh** so my terminal configuration is made for it, if you want to use it don't forget to set your shell to zsh.

Also please check the dependancies below.
